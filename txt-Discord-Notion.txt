"hi everyone"

- I made this (used two Database) 
      1° Software Title
      2° Software Subtemas
      relation to title Software

Vista: Filter DB by  "Software Title" relation

  it's Zettelkasten and look Clean.

hi everyone - I like SUB-TASK (Zettelkasten)

  How could i set one "view DB" 
  that show one "TASK" with its 
  "SUB-TASK"?

  The Example work becuase "Item" 
  is a "Item Principal"


- Filter DB by "Group Name"
      Only work to "Parent"
      Don't work in "SUB-TASK"/"Sub-Item"



EXAMPLE: DATABASE 
Filter DB by its "ITEM PARENT"/"TASK-PARENT" 
And configuring its "ITEMS/TASK" to be flat 
is limiting.
